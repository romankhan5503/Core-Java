/*
the type of data that we store in a variable in java;

there are 8 types in primitive data type:
1. byte (is use for short number. range between is -128 to 127)

2. short (is use for more then byte number.range between is -32678 to 32767)

3.int (is use for then short number. range between is 2 to the power -31    2 to power 31-1)

4.long(is is use for more then int number.range between is 2 to the power -63 to 2 power 63-1)

5. float (is use for floating number. it use compulsary use in final ,because java  does not recognize it as  a float, it recognize as a double)

6.double (it also use for floating numbers. in large Amount)

7.boolean (is use for true or false value )

8.char (is use for single character)
